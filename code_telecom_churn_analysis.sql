/*
1. 	The objective of this SQL project is to present a report (newsletter style) of some BASIC Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	of a fictional Telecommunications Company.
2.	The datasets was taken from Data playground of Maven Analytics  (LINK).
3.	The SQL codes used in this project are to be run in SQL-server.
4.	The server is hosted on a localhost and a database named "TelecomCustomerChurn" is created using SSMS GUI.
5.	The two csv files are imported into this database as tables and created two corresponding tables named:
	 "telecom_customer_churn" and "telecom_zipcode_population.â€œ
6.	Also, the names of Counties are extracted from web (LINK) which corresponds to given relevant zip-codes
	in one of the data sets as follows:
		Get data > From Other Sources> From Web 
7.	For better understanding of the outputs, they are visualized in Power BI
	by extracting the outputs as follows:
		Get data > SQL Server > import (Advanced Options:SQL Statements) > OK 
8.	Finally the codes and their respective visuals are organized in powerpoint and then, saved as pdf file.
9.	Feedbacks and suggestions are always appreciated. THANK YOU.
