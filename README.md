# churn_analysis_telecom_company

1.  The objective of this SQL project is to present a report (newsletter style) of some BASIC Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a fictional Telecommunications Company
2.  The datasets was taken from Data playground of Maven Analytics (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2)
3.  The SQL codes used in this project are to be run in SQL server
4.  The server is hosted on a localhost a nd a database named TelecomCustomerChurn is created using SSMS GUI.
5.  The two csv files are imported into this database as tables and created two corresponding tables named: "telecom_customer_churn " and "telecom_zipcode_population"
6.  Also, the names of Counties are extracted from web (https://www.zip-codes.com/state/ca.asp) which corresponds to given relevant zip codes in one of the data sets as follows:
    Get data > From Other Sources > From Web
7.  For better understanding of the outputs, they are visualized in Power BI by extracting the outputs as follows:
    Get data > SQL Server > import (Advanced Options:SQL Statements) > OK
8.  Finally the codes and their respective visuals are organized in powerpoint and then, saved as pdf file.
9.  Feedbacks and suggestions are always appreciated.
